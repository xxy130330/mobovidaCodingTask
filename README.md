Below is a link to a simple JSON array that contains information about 30 products that we sell on our Shopify site.  Your goal is to use HTML, CSS and Javascript to:
1. Read the API and present the products in an organized way, such as you might see on any other ecommerce site
2. Include at least one filter UI component that will allow the user to restrict the displayed product set by either price, color or some other attribute you would find useful
3. Add a functional sorting element that will re-order the products on the page by Price High-Low and Price Low-High

Feel free to use any frameworks you would like to achieve the task and be sure that your page is presented cleanly across all possible screen widths.

Here is the link you can use to grab the product data in JSON format: https://www.wirelessemporium.com/products.json
